## ðŸ‘‹ I'm Valerio

I'm currently a data scientist at Cuebiq using machine learning to explore geospatial data at scale. I think that my academic background puts me somewhere in between a data scientist and a data engineer.

In my spare time, I like to play video games and watch Netflix shows (I'm a big fan of anime).

I never skip a workout, love traveling and eating.
